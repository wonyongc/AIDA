<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<h3><a name="What is AIDA">What is AIDA?</a></h3>
<p>AIDA is a standard set of interfaces for creating and manipulating 
histograms, n-tuples and related data analysis objects. It has been created 
cooperatively by a <a href="http://aida.freehep.org/guilty_parties.thtml">group of developers</a> working on high-energy physics data 
analysis tools. The goal of the AIDA project is to provide the user with a 
powerful set of interfaces which can be used regardless of which analysis tool 
they are using. The advantages of this approach are that:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The user will only need to learn one set of interfaces even if they use 
  more than one tool.</li>
  <li>By pooling the experiences of several different development teams we will be able 
  to develop a more complete solution to the data analysis problem.</li>
  <li>Different analysis tools built using AIDA will be able to interoperate, 
  for example by exchanging objects in a common storage format (initially XML).</li>
</ol>
<p>Currently two versions of the AIDA interfaces exist, one for Java and one for 
C++. The two interfaces are  as identical as the underlying languages will 
permit.</p>
<p>We have been careful to avoid using a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; approach in 
the development of the AIDA interfaces. Rather than limiting ourselves by the 
existing capabilities of the underlying analysis tools, we have designed a rich 
set of interfaces, with the expectation that the tool developers will need to 
add new features to support the full AIDA functionality. This does mean however 
that the early implementations of AIDA may not completely implement all 
features.</p>
<h3><a name="Example">An Example AIDA Program</a></h3>
<p>Before going into details, here is a trivial example program that uses the 
AIDA interfaces to create a 1D histogram, and display it.</p>
<p><!--webbot bot="HTMLMarkup" StartSpan --><servlet code="ColorizeServlet">
<param name="source" value="examples/Histogram.java">
</servlet><!--webbot BOT="HTMLMarkup" endspan --></p>
<p>A few things to notice in this example, first note that AIDA objects are always 
created from factories. Although different implementations of AIDA may return 
different objects from their factories, the returned objects will all implement 
the same standard AIDA interfaces. In this way it is possible to change from one 
AIDA implementation to another just by changing which 
<a href="../api/hep/aida/IAnalysisFactory.html">IAnalysisFactory</a> is used. </p>
<h2><a name="Overview">Overview of AIDA Classes</a></h2>
<p>The rest of this document describes the key features that the AIDA user will 
need to know about:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="factories.shtml">Factories</a> - Used to instantiate new AIDA objects</li>
  <li><a href="histograms.shtml">Histograms</a> - 1D, 2D and 3D binned histograms.</li>
  <li><a href="clouds.shtml">Clouds</a> - 1D, 2D, and 3D un-binned histograms, useful for scatter plots, rebinnable histograms and for unbinned fits. </li>
  <li><a href="tuples.shtml">Tuples</a> - Arbitrary dimension Tuples </li>
  <li><a href="trees.shtml">Trees</a> - Used for arranging objects into folders, and for IO.</li>
  <li><a href="functions.shtml">Functions</a> - Used for plotting functions and fitting</li>
  <li><a href="fitter.shtml">Fitter</a> - Used to perform binned and unbinned fits to the AIDA data storage objects</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Factories">Factories</a></h3>
<p>In AIDA instead of creating objects directly using &quot;new&quot; one uses factories. 
There is one &quot;master&quot; factory, <a href="../api/hep/aida/IAnalysisFactory.html">
IAnalysisFactory</a> from which other factories are obtained. The 
IAnalysisFactory allows you to obtain factories for creating trees (<a href="../api/hep/aida/ITreeFactory.html">ITreeFactory</a>), 
histograms, clouds and profile histograms (<a href="../api/hep/aida/IHistogramFactory.html">IHistogramFactory</a>), tuples 
(<a href="../api/hep/aida/ITupleFactory.html">ITupleFactory</a>) etc. </p>
<p>You will see many examples of using factories in the remainder of this guide.</p>
