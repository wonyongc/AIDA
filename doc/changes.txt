January 23 2002 (Java + documentation changes, no changes to C++ necessary) tj
- Make documentation in IPlotter clearer, remove spurious boolean returns
- Change IAnalysisFactory to abstract class (pending discussion on mailing list).
- Add proposed dtd for Tuples, plus example xml file
- Add first stab at users guide to doc (http://aida.freehep.org/lib/doc/UsersGuide/index.shtml)

January 10 2002 (Java changes, no changes to C++ necessary)
- added storeName() method to ITree.java
- changed Vector to double[] in IFunctionFactory.java

November 29 2001 (After the too short video meeting)
- Add IPlotter.currentRegion to retrieve the current region index.
- Have IPlotter.createRegion, createRegions.
- Rename IPlotter.reset to IPlotter.clearRegion.
- Have IPlotter.clearPage.
- Remove IPlotter.add, the job being done by IPlotter.plot.
- IPlotter.plot does not move automaticly to the next region.
- Remove show() from IHistogram, IFunction, ICloud.
  The IPlotter is used instead.

November 26 2001 (gb)
- remove IHistogram1D.clearFit (since fit method is now on IFitFunction
  and there is a IPlotter interface).
- add a "starting region index" argument to the IPlotter.setRegions method.
- add IPlotter.remove(IHistogram, IFunction, ICloud).
- add IPlotter.hide().
- IAnnotation.findItem -> IAnnotation.value for coherency
  with IAnnotation.visibility and IAnnotation.value(index).
- add methods to IAnnotation ; the one suggested by Andreas and Pere Mato.

November 23 2001 (gb)
- add IPlotter, IPlotterFactory, IAnalysisFactory.createPlotterFactory.

November 15 2001 (gb)
- add in IAnalysisFactory.h
  extern "C" {
   IAnalysisFactory* AIDA_createAnalysisFactory();
  }
  to hook and implementation.

November 12 2001 (gb)
- add IEvaluator.evaluate.
- add IFilter.accept.
- add IEvaluatorFactory.
- add IFilterFactory.
- add IAnalysisFactory.createEvaluatorFactory.
- add IAnalysisFactory.createFilterFactory.
- add ITuple.project methods.
- supress ITuple.isValid method.
- in IHistogram[1D,2D,3D].h ; supress the forward declaration of the
  class itself.

November 07 2001 (tj)

 - added xml directory containing proposed .dtd file (from CERN)
 - add two example xml files (.aida) to xml directory (from CERN)

 Changes made to .java to bring in-to-line with earlier undocumented changes
 to .h files.
 - add IFunctionFactory corresponding to .h file (not that I like it!)
 - add extra constants in IConstants
 - add new methods in IFitFunction
 - change binCenter methods in IHistogram2D and IHistogram3D (does this make sense?)

Changes meeting Guy, Andreas from 25 October 20
===============================================

 - added createFunctionFactory to IAnalysisFactory

Release 2.1 (not yet tagged in CVS)

August 09 2001 (ap)
- added missing binCentre(...) methods to the histograms.

August 08 2001 (ap)
- added several "const" qualifier to methods in various places.
- re-instantiated use of default arguments for simpler conversion with SWIG
- changed returned strings to be copies instead of references ...
  mainly for backward compatibility (LHCb)

August 07 2001 (ap)
- modified converter to transform "Class" into "const std::string &"
  and return "bool" instead of "void" in order to trap errors (this
  is done for all methods returning void, probably overkill ...)
- converted .java files to .h using converter
- modified IConstants.h by hand for a more "clean" Interface
  (enum for UNDERLOW_BIN/OVERFLOW_BIN, const std::string for version with
  pure virtual std::string version() getter-method)

July 24 2001 (duns)
Fixed two typos:
- IHistogramFactory.div(3D) now returns IHistogram3D
- ITupleFactory.create(String, boolean, boolean, String) now throws IOException

July 19 2001 (tonyj)
Removed sub/mul/div/project/slice methods from IHistogram*
(since they are moved to IHistogramFactory).
Changed documentation on add method in IHistorgram* to make it
clear that it modifies the current histogram.

Add extra "convenience" constructor to ITupleFactory.
     ITuple t = tf.create("MyTuple","My Wonderful Tuple",
                          "float px, py, pz, float energy, int charge",null);
