Generally no ASCII dump routines are provided. Some implementations may choose 
to implement the show methods as ascii dump.

Java methods throw exceptions as appropriate. 
C++ methods should typically return bool instead (until Exceptions are generally available)
C++ will for now return pointers to managed objects, so that it can return 
0 in case of error. These should be changed to references when exceptions are allowed.
